This VBA script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

The conditional formatting for Yearlychange will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Since there are 3 years, the script will loop the other 2 worksheets and populate the above in those respective sheets.
